This is the first project of "The Odin Project"

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the learned HTML knowledge with a basic website

At this point the website won't be beautiful as it is written with plain HTML but will be reworked after the CSS lessons.

You can see the website on: https://scuddi.github.io/odin-recipes/
